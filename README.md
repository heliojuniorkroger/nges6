# nges6
> A CLI for creating AngularJS applications with Webpack and ES6
## Purpose
AngularJS still got something magical for me. Doesn't matters how popular TypeScript become, I will always like the way how AngularJS works. I made this CLI to give a new chance for this awesome framework, integrating with the power of Webpack and ES6, hope you guys enjoy it!
## Installing
Install **nges6** globally:
```bash
npm install -g nges6
```
## Creating your application
To create a new AngularJS application using the CLI, just run:
```bash
nges6 create my-app
```
The CLI will make you some questions, don't worry about it!
## Serving
To start a simple Webpack server, you'll just need to run this:
```bash
npm start
```
## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
After running this, a **dist** folder will be created, with all your application files builded.
